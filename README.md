Assignment for the 2017-2018 University of Edinburgh Compiling Techniques course.

Compiles a subset of the C language to MIPS. Not featured are: array accesses, struct field accesses, some other stuff probably.

The mark obtained for the lexer, parser, and generator together was 40/70.

C code snippets are in the tests folder.

Java Main class arguments are -gen path\to\inputfile path\to\outputfile (use -ast or -lexer instead of -gen to see additional information about the lexing and parsing processes).
